# Experience

**2024** WMG - Summer Internship

- Practically tested the effect of noise factors on state of the art LiDAR sensors to evaluate the safety in autonomous vehicles, integrating them with ROS2 in Ubuntu 22.04.
- Developed documentation in Markdown and managed it using Git, contributing it into the teams GitHub repository by forking and creating pull requests.
- Extracted and processed data from LiDAR and 4D Radar in MATLAB, working with files provided by third parties and my own recordings, creating reproducible and efficient code that is easily readable.
- Collaborated with group members and industrial partners, creating and delivering presentations frequently, as well as taking part in other members discussions.
- Attended weekly meetings with my supervisors where I showcased my progress and received feedback.
- Working on-site every day, developed a good relationship and communicated frequently with the other intern.
- Became more familiar with the academic process, researched current papers on point cloud metrics and autonomous datasets.

**2021 - 2023** Petersfield Shakespeare Festival - Lighting Operator

- Setup and managed the lighting for live performances with a 5 day deadline, demonstrating proficiency in time-sensitive environments.
- Operated the lighting desk for each performance, showcasing adaptability to real-time adjustments.
- Collaborated closely with the cast and stage director to optimize lighting configurations for improved shows.
- Developed skills in planning, teamwork, rigging lights, and operating lighting desks.

# Education

**2022 - 2025** University of Warwick - Cyber Security BSc

- Undertook programming modules covering Java, Rust, C# .NET, Haskell, Blazor, WebAssembly, Python, and PostgreSQL. Additional modules include: Analysing the human psychology with software interfaces. Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins and finally a comprehensive study and implementation of cryptography, for example exploring key exchange and asymmetric encryption in RSA.
- Built a hash checker with Rust [here](https://github.com/rufus-eade/hash_checker).
- I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Linux and how it operates, as well as performing buffer overflows and analysing binaries using GDB, also covering penetration testing on Linux and Windows systems. 
- Created a JavaScript application, and with infrastructure as code, used [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sds-warwick-2/assessment-2-aaf-internal-notes-system/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) and [Pulumi](https://github.com/sds-warwick-2/assessment-2-aaf-internal-notes-system/blob/main/infra/__main__.py) to build a Docker container and deploy it into an AWS EC2 instance, the links show my work in the repository.

**2020 - 2022** HSDC South Downs - Games Design & Development

UAL Level 3 Extended Diploma in Games Design and Development: **Distinction**

UAL Level 3 Diploma in Games Design and Development: **Distinction**

- Solely created a game in Unreal Engine 4, in which the player lands on an alien planet. I created cinematic cutscenes for landing on the planet with Unreal Engine's animation sequencer. Environments, models and textures were made using World Machine, Substance Designer/Painter, Blender and ZBrush. Additionally composing sound effects and background music using BespokeSynth, a modular synthesiser.
- Collaborated on a 2D side-scrolling game in Godot, doing all the programming in GDScript, a language with similar syntax to Python, and contributing to pixel art using Aseprite.
- 3D Modelling/Texturing portfolio made during college: [https://www.artstation.com/rufus_eade](https://www.artstation.com/rufus_eade)
